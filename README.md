# Book-Recommendation-System
This project was developed using Python and Google Colab, using machine learning algorithms to provide personalized book recommendations.

### Features
- Basic Recommender: A simple recommender system that suggests popular books to users based on overall ratings and popularity.

- Content-based Filtering: This algorithm recommends books to users based on the content and attributes of the books they have previously shown interest in. It takes into account factors such as genre, author, and keywords.

- Collaborative Filtering: The collaborative filtering algorithm recommends books by finding users with similar preferences and suggesting books that those similar users have liked.

- Hybrid Approach: Combining the power of both content-based and collaborative filtering, the hybrid approach provides enhanced recommendations, considering both user preferences and book attributes
